Introduction

The Gudhi library is an open source library for Computational Topology and Topological Data Analysis (TDA). It offers state-of-the-art algorithms to construct various types of simplicial complexes, data structures to represent them, and algorithms to compute geometric approximations of shapes and persistent homology.

The GUDHI library offers the following interoperable modules:

Complexes:
Cubical
Simplicial: Rips, Witness, Alpha and Čech complexes
Cover: Nerve and Graph induced complexes
Data structures and basic operations:
Simplex tree, Skeleton blockers and Toplex map
Construction, update, filtration and simplification
Topological descriptors computation
Manifold reconstruction
Topological descriptors tools:
Bottleneck distance
Statistical tools
Persistence diagram and barcode
For more information about Topological Data Analysis and its workflow, please refer to the Wikipedia TDA dedicated page.
