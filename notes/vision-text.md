## Vision Text models

* Moondream 2

A contribution by Twenkid!
Very nice small model: 2B, 0.5B.
Available with Ollama as well.

"bounding box" - returns normalized coordinates.

* Gemma3-4B-it is very good, more powerful than Moondream 2 and works fast even on 1080/8GB  (LMStudio ~30-35 tok/s? once I tested it on a friend's machine ~ April-May 2025)
